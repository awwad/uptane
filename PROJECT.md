# Contributions

We welcome a variety of different kinds of contributions.

## Code Contributions
If you would like to make contributions to this repository, for the reference
implementation or the demonstration code (or the documentation here), you are
encouraged to submit a GitHub pull request to this repository. Please follow
[these development instructions](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/lab-guidelines/blob/master/dev-workflow.md).
Ideally, please include unit tests for any new software feature or change.

Submitted pull requests undergo review and automated testing, including, but
not limited to:
* Unit and build testing via Travis CI
* Review by one or more maintainers


## Code Issues, Bugs, Feature Requests
Issues with the reference implementation or demonstration code in this
repository (e.g. bugs, feature requests, security issues specifically with the
code)
[should be noted in this repository as issues](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/lab-guidelines/issues/new).


## Security Audits
We welcome security audits of the Uptane design, or vulnerability reports of
the design or the code in this repository. Please contact Justin Cappos and
Sebastien Awwad via the contact information above. Uptane is defined in
[the three documents listed here](README.md#design-documentation).

Should the information be highly sensitive, auditors / reporters may employ
PGP encryption in an email to Justin Cappos using the public key whose PGP
fingerprint is listed above.

Audits of TUF alone (which Uptane employs) should instead be submitted
[per these
instructions](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/GOVERNANCE.md).
