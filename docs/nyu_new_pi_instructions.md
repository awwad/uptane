If you're setting up a new Raspberry Pi Primary at NYU, follow the instructions at
https://gist.github.com/awwad/508586f47425608746649641b0c2fa38

(A Partial Verification Secondary will not require some of that - namely the Uptane, TUF, pip, virtualenv, bc, libffi, cryptography, etc. CAN configuration and libuptane will still be necessary.)
