<Program Name>
  secondary.py

<Purpose>
  Provides core functionality for Uptane Secondary ECU clients:
  - Given an archive of metadata and an image file, performs full verification
    of both, employing TUF (The Update Framework), determining if this
    Secondary ECU has been instructed to install the image by the Director and
    if the image is also valid per the Image Repository.
  - Generates ECU Manifests describing the state of the Secondary for Director
    perusal
  - Generates nonces for time requests from the Timeserver, and validates
    signed times provided by the Timeserver, maintaining trustworthy times.
    Rotates nonces after they have appeared in Timeserver responses.

  A detailed explanation of the role of the Secondary in Uptane is available in
  the "Design Overview" and "Implementation Specification" documents, links to
  which are maintained at uptane.github.io

class Secondary(object):

  """
  <Purpose>
    This class contains the necessary code to perform Uptane validation of
    images and metadata. An implementation of Uptane should use code like this
    to perform full validation of images and metadata.

  <Fields>

    self.vin
      A unique identifier for the vehicle that contains this Secondary ECU.
      In this reference implementation, this conforms to
      uptane.formats.VIN_SCHEMA. There is no need to use the vehicle's VIN in
      particular; we simply need a unique identifier for the vehicle, known
      to the Director.

    self.ecu_serial
      A unique identifier for this Secondary ECU. In this reference
      implementation, this conforms to uptane.formats.ECU_SERIAL_SCHEMA.
      (In other implementations, the important point is that this should be
      unique.) The Director should be aware of this identifier.

    self.ecu_key:
      The signing key for this Secondary ECU. This key will be used to sign
      ECU Manifests that will then be sent along to the Primary (and
      subsequently to the Director). The Director should be aware of the
      corresponding public key, so that it can validate these ECU Manifests.
      Conforms to tuf.formats.ANYKEY_SCHEMA.

    self.updater:
      A tuf.client.updater.Updater object used to retrieve metadata and
      target files from the Director and Image repositories.

    self.full_client_dir:
      The full path of the directory where all client data is stored for this
      secondary. This includes verified and unverified metadata and images and
      any temp files. Conforms to tuf.formats.PATH_SCHEMA.

    self.director_repo_name
      The name of the Director repository (e.g. 'director'), as listed in the
      map (or pinning) file (pinned.json). This value must appear in that file.
      Used to distinguish between the Image Repository and the Director
      Repository. Conforms to tuf.formats.REPOSITORY_NAME_SCHEMA.

    self.timeserver_public_key:
      The public key of the Timeserver, which will be used to validate signed
      time attestations from the Timeserver.
      Conforms to tuf.formats.ANYKEY_SCHEMA.

    self.partial_verifying:
      False if this client is to employ full metadata verification (the default)
      with all checks included in the Uptane Implementation Specification,
      else True if this instance is a partial verifier.
      A Partial Verification Secondary is programmed with the Director's
      Targets role public key and will only validate that signature on that
      file, leaving it susceptible to some attacks if the Director key
      is compromised or has to change.

    self.director_public_key
      If this is a partial verification secondary, we store the key that we
      expect the Director to use here. Full verification clients should have
      None in this field. If provided, this conforms to
      tuf.formats.ANYKEY_SCHEMA.

    self.firmware_fileinfo:
      The target file info for the image this Secondary ECU is currently using
      (has currently "installed"). This is generally filename, hash, and
      length. See tuf.formats.TARGETFILE_SCHEMA, which contains
      tuf.formats.FILEINFO_SCHEMA. This info is provided in ECU Manifests
      generated for the Director's consumption.

    self.nonce_next
      Next nonce the ECU will send to the Timeserver (via the Primary).

    self.last_nonce_sent
      The latest nonce this ECU sent to the Timeserver (via the Primary).

    self.all_valid_timeserver_times:
      A list of all times extracted from all Timeserver attestations that have
      been validated by validate_time_attestation.
      Items are appended to the end.

    self.validated_targets_for_this_ecu:
      A list of the targets validated for this ECU, populated in method
      fully_validate_metadata (which is called by method process_metadata).
      # TODO: Since this is now expected to always be one target, this should
      # just be a single value rather than a list....
