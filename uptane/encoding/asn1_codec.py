  Normal behavior ("resign" (re-sign) parameter being False) converts the
  basic Python dictionary format of signed_metadata provided into ASN.1 and
  encodes it as DER, returning the resulting DER encoding of the given metadata.

  "_signed" here refers to the portion of the metadata that will be signed.
  The metadata is divided into "signed" and "signature" portions. The
  signatures are signatures over the "signed" portion. "json_signed" below
  is actually not signed - it is simply the portion that will be put into
  the "signed" section - the portion to be signed. The nomenclature is
  unfortunate....
  TODO: Better variable and function naming.

  <Arguments>
    signed_metadata
      Metadata (time attestation or ecu manifest, for example), and signature(s)
      over it.
      A dictionary with keys 'signed' and 'signatures'.
      signed_metadata must conform to one of the following:
          SIGNABLE_TIMESERVER_ATTESTATION_SCHEMA
          SIGNABLE_VEHICLE_VERSION_MANIFEST_SCHEMA
          SIGNABLE_ECU_VERSION_MANIFEST_SCHEMA

      Each of the above also conforms to tuf.formats.SIGNABLE_SCHEMA.

    datatype:
      String chosen from SUPPORTED_ASN1_METADATA_MODULES.
      Specifies the type of data provided in der_data, whether a Time
      Attestation, ECU Manifest, or Vehicle Manifest. This is used to determine
      the module to use for the conversion.

    resign
      ("re-sign"). Normally False, resulting in the signatures in
      signed_metadata being formatted as ASN.1 and encoded as DER, but otherwise
      preserved (for example, they may still be signatures over JSON - the
      signature values themselves are unchanged).
      If resign is instead True, any signatures provided are
      discarded, and a new signature is generated. This new signature will be
      over the DER encoding of the data provided in signed_metadata['signed'].
      In other words, 'signed' will first be converted into ASN.1 and then
      encoded as DER, and a signature will be made using the given private_key,
      over that DER encoding.
      If the given signatures are already over DER encoding before reaching
      this point (as may happen in the current design), then you will not
      need this to be True.

    private_key
      This should be left out (None) unless resign is True, in which case
      private_key must conform to tuf.formats.ANYKEY_SCHEMA, containing a
      private key, specifically. It will be used to re-sign the metadata
      provided in signed_metadata['signed'].
      Such a key can be imported, for example, through the
      tuf.repository_tool.import_*_private_key() functions.

    only_signed
      Default False. If this is set to True, instead of returning the DER
      encoding of the full {'signed': {"abc..."}, 'signatures': [{"xyz..."}]}
      object, the DER encoding of only the 'signed' entry will be returned
      {"abc..."}.

  <Returns>
    By default (only_signed=False, resign=False), the returned value is the DER
    encoding of the full signed_metadata dictionary.

    If only_signed is True, the returned value is the DER encoding of only the
    'signed' entry in the signed_metadata dictionary.

    Otherwise, if resign is True, the returned value is the DER encoding of the
    full signed_metadata dictionary, but with the 'signatures' entry
    discarded and rebuilt anew with a new signature over the DER ENCODING of the
    'signed' entry in the signed_metadata dictionary.
