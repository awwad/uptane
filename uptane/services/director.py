<Program Name>
  director.py

<Purpose>
  A core module that provides needed functionality for an Uptane-compliant
  Director. This CAN remain largely unchanged in real use. It is upon this that
  a full director is built to OEM specifications. A sample of such a Director
  is in demo/demo_director.py.

  Fundamentally, this code translates lists of vehicle software assignments
  (roughly mapping ECU IDs to targets) into signed metadata suitable for sending
  to a vehicle.

  In particular, this code supports:

    - Initialization of a director given vehicle info, ECU info, ECU public
      keys, Director private keys, etc.

    - Registration of new ECUs, given serial and public key

    - Validation of Vehicle manifests

    - Validation of ECU manifests

    - Writing of signed targets metadata for a given vehicle, given as input
      a map of ecu serials to target info (or filenames from which to extract
      target info)
