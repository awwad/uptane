<Purpose>
  Interface for storing data describing the software state of vehicles served
  by the Director.


  # TODO: <~> This is not properly thread-safe: there may be race conditions if
  Primaries are being switched frequently. The windows are extremely small, but
  assertions related to VIN registration in _check_registration_is_sane() are
  likely to fail if such a race   condition is encountered. Similar race
  conditions may exist. Cautious use of mutexes or a queue is probably
  necessary.



<Globals>
  The following five global dictionaries store information about ECUs and
  vehicles, including their serials, keys, and manifests submitted from
  (ostensibly) them to the Director.

    vehicle_manifests

      A dictionary indexed by the VINs (vehicle identification numbers) of
      known vehicles (uptane.format.VIN_SCHEMA), with values each being lists
      of vehicle manifests from that vehicle - each list element is a manifest
      with structure complying with the format specification
      uptane.formats.SIGNABLE_VEHICLE_VERSION_MANIFEST_SCHEMA.

      All known vehicles should be in this dictionary.

      e.g. {'vin1': [<vehiclemanifest>, <vehiclemanifest>, ...}], 'vin2': []}


    ecu_manifests

      A dictionary indexed by the ECU Serials of known ECUs
      (uptane.format.ECU_SERIAL_SCHEMA), with values each being lists of ECU
      manifests from that ECU. Individual list elements comply with
      uptane.formats.SIGNABLE_ECU_VERSION_MANIFEST_SCHEMA.

      This is duplicated data, as all ECU Manifests were extracted from Vehicle
      Manifests which are also saved in full in global vehicle_manifests.

      All known ECU Serials should be in this dictionary.

      e.g. {'ecuserial1': [<ecumanifest>, <ecumanifest>], 'ecuserial2': []}


    primary_ecus_by_vin

      A dictionary mapping VIN of a vehicle (uptane.formats.VIN_SCHEMA) to the
      ECU Serial (uptane.formats.ECU_SERIAL_SCHEMA) of the vehicle's Primary
      ECU.

      All known vehicles should be in this dictionary. If a vehicle has no
      registered Primary ECU for some reason, the value should be set to None.

      e.g. {'vin1': 'ecuserial1', 'vin2': 'ecuserial2'}


    ecus_by_vin

      A dictionary mapping VIN of a vehicle (uptane.formats.VIN_SCHEMA) to a
      list of the ECU Serials (uptane.formats.ECU_SERIAL_SCHEMA) of all ECUs
      associated with that vehicle.

      All known vehicles should have their VIN in this dictionary.

      e.g.
          {'vin1': ['ecuserial1', 'ecuserial9'],
           'vin2': ['ecuserial2']}

      This is used to both identify known VINs and associate ECUs with VINs.
      Identifying known ECUs is generally done instead by checking the
      ecu_public_keys field, since that is flat.


    ecu_public_keys

      A dictionary mapping ECU Serial (uptane.formats.ECU_SERIAL_SCHEMA) of an
      ECU to the public key (conforming to uptane.formats.ANYKEY_SCHEMA) that
      corresponds to the signing key we expect that ECU to use.

      All known ECUs should have their ECU Serial in this dictionary.

      e.g. {'ecuserial1': <key>, 'ecuserial2': <key>, ...}
